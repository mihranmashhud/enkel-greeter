This is a fork of the very pretty enkel theme by vndre.
In this fork I have added a better user experience:
1. A user now may only have to type their username after a boot.
2. When a username is typed that users last session is automatically chosen.
3. The clock uses 12 hour time instead of 24 hour.
4. There is now a demo of the theme!
